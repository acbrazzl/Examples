# Sayit
A Basic Python CLI App w/ Argparse & Unittest

## Intro
Sayit.py is a basic app that displays some rough framework to build on.  
The #TODO statements in the code are numbered in the intended order that 
one would implement as you learn.

## Getting Started

Get started by cloning the repo from github with `git clone https://github.com/acbrazzl/Examples`, or by downloading the zip from the same url.  Navigate to `sayit/teaching`, this is the location of `sayit.py`.

Open `sayit.py` and `test_sayit.py` in your favorite IDE.

Run the app with `python3 sayit.py --help` to display the built-in CLI help tooling that argparse provides.

## Making Changes

Implement the #TODO statements in the order they are numbered, or do whatever!

## Unittest

Run unit tests with `python3 test_sayit.py`.  Note that depending on your
dev environment, you may be able to use the unittest cli.  That won't be discussed here however.
