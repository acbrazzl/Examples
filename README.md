# Examples

These are example snippets of basic linked list implementations in c, c++, and python.  Each is behaviorally different, but all hinge on my love of Boop & Doot junk words.  Checkout the python3 implementation of argparse with LinkedList appending of any CLI arg provided with `-s`.  

They were inspired by a Geeks4Geeks (article)[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-set-1-introduction/], but show some improvisation on my part.
